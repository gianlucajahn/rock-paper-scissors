### The popular kid's game, made with JavaScript.  üóø üìú ‚úÇÔ∏è

Within the script.js file, which is linked in the index.html file, the code is being explained more than thoroughly. I did so to:

1. Make myself look up the exact names of different parts of JavaScript (objects, functions, parameters...), kind of as a re-view.
2. To show my understanding of every part of the code and to show my intention with the parts respectively.

## TL;DR:

Inside of the script.js file, there's way more comments than this program needs and way more than one would use in a real-life project of this size. I used them to better my understanding of every line of code. Since this IS a project made to learn off, I used it to do exactly that with said comments. In a real-life project, you would only want to comment out lines that are not understood at first glance without a comment.

#### Additional Note: 

I am aware of the fact that the comparePicks function could be made much more compact by grouping picks together. Since this is my first JavaScript project, I sticked to what I initially planned it to look like in pseudocode. I will use a more optimized and compact variant when making a webpage with a graphical interface for the script. You can find more to all of that within the comments in the script.js file, specifically line 55 to 57 for this.
